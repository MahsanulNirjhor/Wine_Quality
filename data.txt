Feature descriptions in dataset

fixed acidity
Most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily).
Type: Numeric

volatile acidity
The amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.
Type: Numeric

citric acid
Found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines.
Type: Numeric

residual sugar
The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet.
Type: Numeric

chlorides
The amount of salt in the wine.
Type: Numeric

free sulfur dioxide
the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.
Type: Numeric

total sulfur dioxide
Amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine.
Type: Numeric

density
The density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content.
Type: Numeric

pH
describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale.
Type: Numeric

sulphates
a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.
Type: Numeric

alcohol
The percent alcohol content of the wine.
Type: Numeric

quality
output variable (based on sensory data, score between 0 and 10).
Type: Numeric
